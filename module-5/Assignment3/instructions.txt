To create a simple WPF application using XAML and C#, follow these step-by-step instructions. In this example, we'll create a basic calculator application.

Step 1: Create a New WPF Project

Open Visual Studio or your preferred C# development environment.

Create a new WPF App project:

Go to "File" > "New" > "Project..."
Search for "WPF App (.NET Core)" or a similar option.
Give your project a name (e.g., "CalculatorApp") and choose a location.
Click "Create" or "OK" to create the project.
Step 2: Understanding WPF and XAML

Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is a framework for building modern desktop applications with rich user interfaces. It offers a flexible and powerful way to create interactive and visually appealing desktop applications.

Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) is a declarative XML-based language used to define the structure and appearance of the user interface in WPF applications. XAML allows you to separate the design of your application's UI from its behavior, making it easier to collaborate with designers and developers.

Step 3: Design the User Interface (UI) with XAML

Design the UI of your WPF application using XAML. Here's a basic design for a calculator application:

In Solution Explorer, open the "MainWindow.xaml" file.

Replace the existing XAML code with the following XAML code:

xml
Copy code
<Window x:Class="CalculatorApp.MainWindow"
        xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        Title="Calculator" Height="400" Width="300">
    <Grid>
        <TextBox Name="resultTextBox" HorizontalAlignment="Right" VerticalAlignment="Top" Margin="10" FontSize="20"/>
        <Button Content="7" HorizontalAlignment="Left" VerticalAlignment="Center" Width="60" Height="60" Margin="10,80,0,0" FontSize="20" Click="Number_Click"/>
        <!-- Add buttons for digits 0-9, operators (+, -, *, /), and equals (=) -->
    </Grid>
</Window>
Customize the XAML code to include buttons for digits 0-9, operators (+, -, *, /), and an equals (=) button. Ensure that you set the appropriate properties like Name, Content, HorizontalAlignment, VerticalAlignment, and Click event handlers.
Step 4: Implement Functionality in C#

Now, implement the functionality of your calculator application using C#. Here's a basic structure for the code:

csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.Windows;
using System.Windows.Controls;

namespace CalculatorApp
{
    public partial class MainWindow : Window
    {
        private string currentInput = string.Empty;
        private double result = 0;
        private string currentOperator = string.Empty;

        public MainWindow()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        private void Number_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
        {
            Button button = (Button)sender;
            currentInput += button.Content;
            resultTextBox.Text = currentInput;
        }

        // Implement event handlers for operator buttons (+, -, *, /) and equals (=)
        // Update the currentInput and resultTextBox accordingly

        private void Clear_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
        {
            currentInput = string.Empty;
            result = 0;
            currentOperator = string.Empty;
            resultTextBox.Text = currentInput;
        }
    }
}
Step 5: Build and Run the Application

Save your changes.

Build the project by clicking "Build" > "Build Solution" in Visual Studio.

Run the application by clicking "Start" or pressing F5.

Step 6: Testing

Test your calculator application to ensure that all features work as expected. Perform calculations and verify the results.

Step 7: Documentation

Add comments to your XAML and C# code to explain the purpose of each XAML element and event handler.

Step 8: Create a README File

Create a README file (e.g., README.txt or README.md) in your project folder and provide instructions on how to run the WPF application and how to use its features.

Step 9: Submission

Compile your project into a zip file containing the complete WPF project, including all XAML and C# source code and the README file. Submit this zip file for your assignment.

That's it! You've created a simple WPF calculator application using XAML and C#. Users can perform basic arithmetic operations using this application.
