Step 1: Relational Database Design Process

Begin by explaining the process of designing a relational database:

Identifying Requirements and Objectives:
The first step in designing a relational database is to identify the requirements and objectives of the database. This involves understanding the purpose of the database, what data it will store, and how that data will be used. For example, in the case of a library database, you'd need to know what information should be tracked, such as books, authors, borrowers, and due dates.

Defining Entities and Attributes:
Once you have a clear understanding of the requirements, you can define the entities and attributes. Entities represent objects or concepts in the real world (e.g., Books, Authors), and attributes represent properties of those entities (e.g., Title, AuthorID, PublicationYear). For example, an Author entity might have attributes like AuthorID, FirstName, and LastName.

Specifying Data Types:
For each attribute, you need to specify the data type that determines what kind of data can be stored in it. Common data types include text, integer, date, decimal, and more. For instance, Title could be of data type text, AuthorID might be an integer, and PublicationYear could be a date.

Normalizing the Database:
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity. This involves breaking down large tables into smaller ones and linking them through relationships. Normalization reduces data anomalies and makes the database more efficient. For example, you might split a single table of Books into separate tables for Authors and Books, linked by AuthorID.

Creating Relationships:
Relationships between tables are established using keysâ€”primary keys and foreign keys. A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table, while a foreign key links records in one table to records in another. For instance, the AuthorID in the Books table might be a foreign key that links to the primary key of the Authors table.

Step 2: Hypothetical Database Scenario

Let's choose a hypothetical scenario for our database design: an e-commerce website. The database will include tables for Customers, Orders, Products, and OrderDetails.

Step 3: Database Schema Design

Table 1: Customers

Attributes:
CustomerID (Primary Key)
FirstName
LastName
Email
Address
Table 2: Orders

Attributes:
OrderID (Primary Key)
CustomerID (Foreign Key)
OrderDate
Status
Table 3: Products

Attributes:
ProductID (Primary Key)
Name
Description
Price
Table 4: OrderDetails

Attributes:
OrderDetailID (Primary Key)
OrderID (Foreign Key)
ProductID (Foreign Key)
Quantity
Subtotal
Step 4: Normalization

Normalization involves organizing data efficiently. In our scenario, we have normalized the data by breaking it into separate tables: Customers, Orders, Products, and OrderDetails. This separation eliminates redundancy and ensures data consistency. For example, instead of duplicating customer information in each order, we link orders to customers using the CustomerID foreign key.

This normalization also ensures that updates (e.g., changing a customer's address) need to be made in only one place, improving data integrity.

Submission:

Compile your explanations of the relational database design process, the hypothetical database schema, and the importance of normalization into a document (PDF or Word). Ensure that each concept is clearly explained and that your database schema is logically structured.

Submit the document as your assignment submission.
