To create a functional Windows Forms application for task management in C#, you can follow these step-by-step instructions. In this example, we'll create a simple to-do list application.

Step 1: Create a New Windows Forms Application Project

Open Visual Studio or your preferred C# development environment.

Create a new Windows Forms Application project:

Go to "File" > "New" > "Project..."
Select "Windows Forms App (.NET Core)" or a similar option.
Give your project a name (e.g., "TaskManagerApp") and choose a location.
Click "Create" or "OK" to create the project.
Step 2: Design the User Interface (UI)

Design the user interface of your Windows Forms application. Here's a basic design for a to-do list application:

In the form designer, drag and drop the following controls from the Toolbox onto the form:

Label: Place it at the top with the text "To-Do List."
TextBox: Place it below the label to enter new tasks. Name it "textBoxTask."
Button: Place it next to the textbox with the text "Add Task." Name it "buttonAddTask."
ListBox: Place it below the textbox and button to display the list of tasks. Name it "listBoxTasks."
Button: Place it below the ListBox with the text "Mark Complete." Name it "buttonMarkComplete."
Button: Place it below the "Mark Complete" button with the text "Delete Task." Name it "buttonDeleteTask."
Button: Place it below the "Delete Task" button with the text "Clear All Tasks." Name it "buttonClearAllTasks."
Resize and align the controls as needed to create a visually appealing form.

Step 3: Implement Functionality

Implement the functionality of your task management application using C#. Here's a basic structure for the code:

csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace TaskManagerApp
{
    public partial class MainForm : Form
    {
        public MainForm()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        // Create a list to store tasks
        private List<string> tasks = new List<string>();

        // Event handler for the "Add Task" button
        private void buttonAddTask_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            string newTask = textBoxTask.Text.Trim();
            
            // Check if the task is not empty
            if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(newTask))
            {
                // Add the task to the list and update the ListBox
                tasks.Add(newTask);
                listBoxTasks.Items.Add(newTask);
                textBoxTask.Clear();
            }
        }

        // Event handler for the "Mark Complete" button
        private void buttonMarkComplete_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            int selectedIndex = listBoxTasks.SelectedIndex;
            
            // Check if a task is selected
            if (selectedIndex >= 0)
            {
                // Mark the selected task as complete by adding "[Completed]" to its description
                tasks[selectedIndex] = "[Completed] " + tasks[selectedIndex];
                listBoxTasks.Items[selectedIndex] = tasks[selectedIndex];
            }
        }

        // Event handler for the "Delete Task" button
        private void buttonDeleteTask_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            int selectedIndex = listBoxTasks.SelectedIndex;
            
            // Check if a task is selected
            if (selectedIndex >= 0)
            {
                // Remove the selected task from the list and update the ListBox
                tasks.RemoveAt(selectedIndex);
                listBoxTasks.Items.RemoveAt(selectedIndex);
            }
        }

        // Event handler for the "Clear All Tasks" button
        private void buttonClearAllTasks_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Clear the list of tasks and update the ListBox
            tasks.Clear();
            listBoxTasks.Items.Clear();
        }
    }
}
Step 4: Build and Run the Application

Save your changes.

Build the project by clicking "Build" > "Build Solution" in Visual Studio.

Run the application by clicking "Start" or pressing F5.

Step 5: Testing

Test your application to ensure that all features work as expected. Add tasks, mark them as complete, delete tasks, and clear all tasks.

Step 6: Documentation

Add comments to your code to explain the purpose of each component and event handler.

Step 7: Create a README File

Create a README file (e.g., README.txt or README.md) in your project folder and provide instructions on how to run the Windows Forms application and how to use its features.

Step 8: Submission

Compile your project into a zip file containing the complete C# project, including all source code and the README file. Submit this zip file for your assignment.

That's it! You've created a functional Windows Forms application for task management in C#. Users can add, mark as complete, delete, and clear tasks using this application.
