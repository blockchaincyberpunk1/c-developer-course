Control Structures and Loops in C#

Objective: Gain proficiency in control structures and loops in C#.

Task: In this assignment, you will write two separate C# programs to demonstrate your understanding of control structures and loops.

Part 1: Control Structures (50 points)

Write a C# program that accomplishes the following:

Prompt the user to enter their age.
Use an if-else statement to make a decision based on the user's age. The program should do the following:
If the user's age is less than 18, display a message like "You are a minor."
If the user's age is between 18 and 65 (inclusive), display a message like "You are an adult."
If the user's age is greater than or equal to 65, display a message like "You are a senior citizen."
Ensure that the program handles various age ranges correctly.

Part 2: Loops (50 points)

Write another C# program that accomplishes the following:

Use a loop (either a for or while loop) to perform the following task:

Display the numbers from 1 to 10, one number per line.
Use a loop (either a for or while loop) to perform the following task:

Calculate and display the sum of the first 10 natural numbers (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10).
Submission: Submit the following for your assignment:

The source code for both programs.
Any additional instructions or explanations necessary to understand your code.
Grading Criteria:

Correctness and functionality of the control structures and loops in the programs.
Proper handling of user input and decision-making based on the user's age.
Proper implementation of loops to display numbers and calculate sums.
Adherence to C# coding conventions and best practices.
Overall presentation and organization of the assignment.
