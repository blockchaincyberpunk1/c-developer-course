Exploring Dictionary Collections

Objective: Study dictionary collections available in the .NET Framework.

Task: In this assignment, you will explore the concept of dictionary collections in C# and the .NET Framework. Your objective is to choose the Dictionary<TKey, TValue> class from the .NET Framework and explain its purpose and usage. Additionally, you will develop a C# program that demonstrates how to create and use a dictionary to efficiently store and retrieve key-value pairs.

Part 1: Dictionary Explanation

Choose the Dictionary<TKey, TValue> class as your focus for this assignment.
Explain the following aspects of the Dictionary<TKey, TValue> class:
Purpose: Describe what a dictionary is and how it is used in programming.
Key-Value Pairs: Explain how key-value pairs work within a dictionary.
Generic Types: Clarify the significance of the generic types TKey and TValue and their role in dictionary creation.
Methods and Properties: Highlight some essential methods and properties provided by the Dictionary<TKey, TValue> class for adding, removing, and querying key-value pairs.
Efficiency: Discuss the efficiency of dictionary operations, especially for large datasets.
Part 2: C# Program

Develop a C# program that demonstrates the usage of the Dictionary<TKey, TValue> class. Your program should include the following elements:

Creation of a Dictionary<TKey, TValue> object.
Addition of key-value pairs to the dictionary.
Retrieval of values based on keys.
Removal of key-value pairs.
Iteration through the dictionary to display its contents.
Ensure that your program is well-documented with comments to explain each section of the code. Include clear and informative output to showcase the results of each dictionary operation.

Example Explanation (Part 1):


**Dictionary Explanation:**

**Purpose:**
A dictionary is a collection that stores key-value pairs. It allows you to efficiently look up values based on their associated keys. The `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` class in C# is a generic collection that provides fast access to values using unique keys.

**Key-Value Pairs:**
In a dictionary, each key is associated with a single value. This means that you can store and retrieve data in an organized manner, with the ability to quickly locate values using their corresponding keys.

**Generic Types:**
The `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` class is generic, meaning you can specify the types of keys (`TKey`) and values (`TValue`) it will hold. This ensures type safety and flexibility when working with different data types.

**Methods and Properties:**
Some important methods and properties provided by `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` include `Add`, `Remove`, `ContainsKey`, `Keys`, `Values`, and more. These methods allow you to add, remove, check for the existence of keys, and retrieve keys or values.

**Efficiency:**
Dictionaries are highly efficient for key-based data retrieval. They use hashing algorithms to provide fast access to values, making them suitable for applications where quick data lookup is crucial, such as caching or indexing.


Example (Part 2):


using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class DictionaryDemo
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create a dictionary of students and their ages
        Dictionary<string, int> studentAges = new Dictionary<string, int>();

        // Add key-value pairs
        studentAges["Alice"] = 20;
        studentAges["Bob"] = 22;
        studentAges["Charlie"] = 21;

        // Retrieve values by keys
        Console.WriteLine("Age of Alice: " + studentAges["Alice"]);
        Console.WriteLine("Age of Bob: " + studentAges["Bob"]);

        // Remove a key-value pair
        studentAges.Remove("Charlie");

        // Iterate through the dictionary
        Console.WriteLine("\nStudent Ages:");
        foreach (var kvp in studentAges)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{kvp.Key}: {kvp.Value} years old");
        }
    }
}
