Mini Project - Simple Calculator in C#

Objective: Apply C# programming fundamentals to build a simple calculator.

Task: In this assignment, you will develop a C# program for a basic calculator that can perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input. You will create a user-friendly interface with a command-line menu to select the desired operation and input numbers.

Requirements:

Your calculator should provide the following functionality:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
The program should display a menu to the user, allowing them to select the desired operation (e.g., by entering a number or a symbol).

After selecting an operation, the program should prompt the user to input two numbers (operands) on separate lines.

Perform the selected arithmetic operation on the input numbers and display the result to the user.

Ensure error handling: Handle cases where the user provides invalid input (e.g., non-numeric input or division by zero).

Example Output:

Here's an example of what the program's interaction with the user might look like:


Welcome to the Simple Calculator!
Please select an operation:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)

Enter the number corresponding to your choice: 1

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5

Result: 10 + 5 = 15
Submission: Submit the source code of your C# calculator program.

Grading Criteria:

Correct implementation of arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Proper user interface with a clear menu and input prompts.
Error handling for invalid input (e.g., non-numeric input, division by zero).
Adherence to C# coding conventions and best practices.
Overall functionality and usability of the calculator.
