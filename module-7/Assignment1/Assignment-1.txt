Database Concepts and SQL Basics

Objective: Understand fundamental database concepts and SQL querying.

Task: In this assignment, you will explore the fundamental concepts of databases and SQL (Structured Query Language). You will explain key database concepts and write SQL queries to perform basic operations on a hypothetical database.

Instructions:

Research Database Concepts: Begin by researching and understanding the fundamental concepts of databases. Explain the following concepts:

Tables: What are tables in a database, and how are they used to store data?
Rows and Columns: Describe the structure of tables, including rows and columns.
Keys: Explain primary keys and foreign keys and their importance in database design.
Relationships: Describe how tables can be related to each other through keys.
Hypothetical Database: Imagine a hypothetical database for a library. It contains two tables: Books and Authors. The Books table includes columns such as BookID, Title, AuthorID, and PublicationYear. The Authors table includes columns like AuthorID, FirstName, and LastName.

SQL Queries: Write SQL queries to perform the following operations on the hypothetical database:

a. Selecting Data:

Write a query to select all books from the Books table.
Write a query to select the title and publication year of books published in 2020.
b. Inserting Data:

Write a query to insert a new book into the Books table. Include values for all relevant columns.
c. Updating Data:

Write a query to update the publication year of a specific book in the Books table.
d. Deleting Data:

Write a query to delete an author from the Authors table along with all their associated books from the Books table.
Explanations: Alongside each SQL query, provide explanations for what the query does and how it achieves the desired result.

Example Usage:

For example, you can explain that SQL SELECT queries retrieve data from a table, and you can specify the columns you want to retrieve. SQL INSERT queries add new records to a table, and you provide values for each column.

Submission: Submit a document (PDF or Word) containing the explanations of the key database concepts and the SQL queries you wrote. Include explanations for each query.

Grading Criteria:

Clear explanations of key database concepts.
Correct SQL queries that perform the specified operations.
Accurate and concise explanations for each SQL query.
Properly formatted and organized submission.
