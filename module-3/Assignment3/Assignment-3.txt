Exception Handling Basics

Objective: Explore the basics of exception handling in C#.

Task: In this assignment, you will learn about exceptions and their significance in C# for robust error handling. You are required to write a C# program that intentionally generates exceptions (e.g., division by zero, null reference) and demonstrates how to catch and handle these exceptions using try-catch blocks.

Requirements:

Understanding Exceptions: Begin by providing a clear and concise explanation of what exceptions are in the context of programming and why they are essential for robust error handling. Describe scenarios where exceptions commonly occur.

C# Program: Write a C# program that includes code segments intentionally designed to generate exceptions. You can use scenarios like attempting to divide by zero, accessing null references, or attempting to read from a non-existent file.

Try-Catch Blocks: Implement try-catch blocks in your program to catch and handle the exceptions that are intentionally generated. Ensure that you provide meaningful error messages or information when handling each exception.

Demonstration: Run your program and demonstrate how each exception is caught and handled. Show that the program continues execution after handling each exception.

Example Explanation:

Exceptions are runtime errors that can occur in a program due to unexpected situations, such as division by zero or trying to access properties or methods of null objects. Handling exceptions allows a program to gracefully respond to these errors without crashing.

Example (C# Code):


using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Example 1: Division by Zero Exception
        int numerator = 10;
        int denominator = 0;
        try
        {
            int result = numerator / denominator; // Attempting division by zero
            Console.WriteLine("Result of division: " + result);
        }
        catch (DivideByZeroException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Error: " + ex.Message);
        }

        // Example 2: Null Reference Exception
        string text = null;
        try
        {
            int length = text.Length; // Attempting to access length of null reference
            Console.WriteLine("Length of text: " + length);
        }
        catch (NullReferenceException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Error: " + ex.Message);
        }

        // Other examples...

        Console.WriteLine("Program continues execution...");
    }
}



Submission: Submit your C# program along with a clear explanation of exceptions and their importance in error handling. Describe the exceptions you intentionally generated in your program and how you handled them using try-catch blocks.

Grading Criteria:

Understanding of exceptions and their importance (clear and concise explanation).
Proper implementation of try-catch blocks to handle exceptions.
Correct demonstration of how exceptions are caught and handled in the program.
Clarity and completeness of the assignment.
