Certainly! I'll walk you through the steps to create a simple ASP.NET web application that displays a greeting message along with the current date and time. We'll use Visual Studio for this example.

Step 1: Create a New ASP.NET Web Application

Open Visual Studio.

Go to "File" > "New" > "Project..."

In the "Create a new project" dialog, search for "ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Core)".

Choose a name and location for your project, then click the "Create" button.

In the "Create a new ASP.NET Core web application" dialog, select the "Web Application" template and click the "Create" button.

Step 2: Design the Web Page

In Solution Explorer, open the "Pages" folder.

Right-click on the "Pages" folder and add a new Razor Page called "Index.cshtml".

In "Index.cshtml", add the following HTML and Razor code to create the web page:

html
Copy code
@page
@model IndexModel
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>ASP.NET Greeting</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/site.css" />
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to ASP.NET!</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>@Model.Greeting</p>
        <p>Current date and time: @DateTime.Now</p>
    </main>
</body>
</html>
This code creates a simple HTML page with a greeting message and displays the current date and time using Razor syntax.

Step 3: Add C# Code

In the "Pages" folder, open "Index.cshtml.cs".

Add the following C# code to the OnGet method to set the greeting message:

csharp
Copy code
public class IndexModel : PageModel
{
    public string Greeting { get; set; }

    public void OnGet()
    {
        Greeting = "Hello, ASP.NET!";
    }
}
This code sets the Greeting property to "Hello, ASP.NET!" when the page is loaded.

Step 4: Add CSS (Optional)

You can create a "site.css" file in the "wwwroot/css" folder to style your page. For example, you can add the following CSS to center-align the text:

css
Copy code
body {
    text-align: center;
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

header {
    background-color: #007bff;
    color: white;
    padding: 20px;
}

main {
    margin-top: 20px;
}
Step 5: Run the Application

Save your changes.

Build the project by clicking "Build" > "Build Solution" in Visual Studio.

Run the application by clicking "Debug" > "Start Without Debugging" or simply press Ctrl+F5.

Step 6: Documentation

Include documentation that explains the purpose of each component, the role of C# in generating dynamic content, and how CSS is incorporated for styling.

Step 7: Submission

Compile your project into a zip file containing the complete ASP.NET project files, including the source code and the README document that provides the explanation. Submit this zip file for your assignment.

That's it! You've created a simple ASP.NET web application that displays a greeting message and the current date and time.
