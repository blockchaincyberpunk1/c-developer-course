Creating a full-fledged web application is a complex task that may require significant time and effort. In this step-by-step guide, I'll provide you with a simplified example of a web application. This example will demonstrate some basic ASP.NET features and concepts, but it won't cover the full scope of a real-world web application.

Scenario: We will create a simplified online store application that allows users to view product listings, add items to a shopping cart, and view their cart.

Step 1: Create a New ASP.NET Web Application

Open Visual Studio.

Go to "File" > "New" > "Project..."

In the "Create a new project" dialog, select "ASP.NET Core Web Application" and click "Next."

Choose a name and location for your project, then click "Create."

In the "Create a new ASP.NET Core web application" dialog, select the "Web Application" template and click "Create."

Step 2: Design the User Interface

In Solution Explorer, open the "Pages" folder.

Open the "Index.cshtml" file and replace its content with the following code:

html
Copy code
@page
@model IndexModel
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Online Store";
}

<h1>Welcome to the Online Store</h1>

<h2>Product Listings</h2>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="javascript:addToCart(1)">Product 1 - $10</a></li>
        <li><a href="javascript:addToCart(2)">Product 2 - $15</a></li>
        <li><a href="javascript:addToCart(3)">Product 3 - $20</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>Shopping Cart</h2>
<div>
    <ul id="cart">
    </ul>
</div>

<script>
    function addToCart(productId) {
        var cart = document.getElementById("cart");
        var listItem = document.createElement("li");
        listItem.appendChild(document.createTextNode("Product " + productId));
        cart.appendChild(listItem);
    }
</script>
This code creates a simple web page with product listings and a shopping cart. Users can click on product links to add items to the cart using JavaScript.

Step 3: Implement Functionality

In the "Pages" folder, open "Index.cshtml.cs."

Add the following C# code to the OnGet method to handle the dynamic content generation:

csharp
Copy code
public class IndexModel : PageModel
{
    public void OnGet()
    {
    }
}
Since we are using JavaScript to handle cart functionality, there is no need for complex C# code in this example.

Step 4: Validation (Optional)

For simplicity, we won't add input validation in this basic example. In a real-world application, you should validate user inputs to ensure data integrity and security.

Step 5: Run the Application

Save your changes.

Build the project by clicking "Build" > "Build Solution" in Visual Studio.

Run the application by clicking "Debug" > "Start Without Debugging" or pressing Ctrl+F5.

Step 6: Documentation

Create a documentation document (PDF or Word) that outlines the purpose and features of your application and provides clear instructions on how to interact with it. Since this is a simplified example, you can briefly describe the application's purpose and how to add items to the cart.

Step 7: Submission

Compile your project into a zip file containing the complete ASP.NET project files, including the source code and the documentation document. Submit this zip file for your assignment.

This example demonstrates the basics of creating a web application using ASP.NET Core. In a real-world scenario, you would need to implement server-side logic, database interactions, user authentication, and more.
