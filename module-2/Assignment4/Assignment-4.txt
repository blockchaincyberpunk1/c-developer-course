Lambda Expressions

Objective: Explore lambda expressions in C#.

Task: In this assignment, you will write a C# program that uses lambda expressions to perform various tasks like sorting a list of objects, filtering data, or transforming data. Provide examples of lambda expressions used in your program and explain how they simplify code and enhance readability.

Requirements:

Select a scenario: Choose a scenario where lambda expressions can be beneficial. For example, you can work with a collection of objects that need sorting, filtering, or transformation.

Write a C# program: Create a C# program (e.g., Program.cs) to implement your scenario. In this program, you should use lambda expressions to achieve specific tasks.

Use lambda expressions: Utilize lambda expressions for tasks like sorting objects in a list, filtering data based on specific conditions, or transforming data elements.

Explain the lambda expressions: For each lambda expression used in your program, provide a comment or explanation to clarify its purpose and how it simplifies the code or enhances readability.

Example (Sorting a List of Students by Name):


using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create a list of students
        List<Student> students = new List<Student>
        {
            new Student { Name = "Alice", Age = 25 },
            new Student { Name = "Bob", Age = 21 },
            new Student { Name = "Charlie", Age = 23 },
            new Student { Name = "David", Age = 20 }
        };

        // Sort students by name using a lambda expression
        students.Sort((student1, student2) => student1.Name.CompareTo(student2.Name));

        // Display the sorted list
        Console.WriteLine("Sorted Students by Name:");
        foreach (var student in students)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Name: {student.Name}, Age: {student.Age}");
        }
    }
}

class Student
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}


Submission: Submit the source code of your C# program (Program.cs) that demonstrates the use of lambda expressions, along with comments explaining the purpose of each lambda expression.

Grading Criteria:

Correct usage of lambda expressions in the selected scenario.
Clear and concise explanations provided for each lambda expression.
Demonstrated understanding of how lambda expressions simplify code and enhance readability.
Adherence to C# coding conventions and best practices.
