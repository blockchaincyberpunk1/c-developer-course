Creating a full mini-project like the "Collection Library Application" involves multiple steps and code components. Due to the complexity and length of the project, I'll provide a step-by-step guide for creating the application, focusing on the main structure and critical code sections. You can then build upon this foundation to implement the full application.

Let's start with the initial setup and the main menu of the application:

Step 1: Set Up Your C# Project

Open your preferred C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).

Create a new Console Application project. Name it "CollectionLibraryApp" or a similar name.

Step 2: Define Item Classes

You need to define classes to represent different types of items (e.g., Book, Movie, Music). For simplicity, I'll demonstrate this with a "Book" class:

csharp
Copy code
class Book
{
    public string ISBN { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Author { get; set; }
    public int Year { get; set; }
}
Step 3: Create Collection Classes

Create classes to represent collections of items (e.g., BooksCollection, MoviesCollection, MusicCollection). Each class should use a suitable collection type (e.g., List<Book>, List<Movie>, Dictionary<string, Music>). Here's an example for the "BooksCollection":

csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class BooksCollection
{
    private List<Book> books = new List<Book>();

    public void AddBook(Book book)
    {
        books.Add(book);
    }

    public List<Book> GetAllBooks()
    {
        return books;
    }

    // Implement other methods for managing the collection (e.g., EditBook, SearchBook).
}
Step 4: Create the Main Menu

Create the main menu to display options to the user. Here's a simplified version:

csharp
Copy code
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        while (true)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Main Menu:");
            Console.WriteLine("1. View Collections");
            Console.WriteLine("2. Manage Collection");
            Console.WriteLine("3. Exit");

            string choice = Console.ReadLine();

            switch (choice)
            {
                case "1":
                    ViewCollections();
                    break;
                case "2":
                    ManageCollection();
                    break;
                case "3":
                    Environment.Exit(0);
                    break;
                default:
                    Console.WriteLine("Invalid choice. Please try again.");
                    break;
            }
        }
    }

    static void ViewCollections()
    {
        // Implement listing available collections here.
    }

    static void ManageCollection()
    {
        // Implement collection management options here.
    }
}
Step 5: Implement Collection Listing (View Collections)

Implement the ViewCollections method to list available collections. You can use a dictionary to store collection names and their corresponding collection objects:

csharp
Copy code
static Dictionary<int, string> collectionNames = new Dictionary<int, string>
{
    { 1, "Books" },
    { 2, "Movies" },
    { 3, "Music" }
};

static void ViewCollections()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Available Collections:");
    foreach (var entry in collectionNames)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{entry.Key}. {entry.Value}");
    }
}
Step 6: Implement Collection Management (Manage Collection)

Implement the ManageCollection method for managing specific collections. You can use a switch statement based on the user's collection choice:

csharp
Copy code
static void ManageCollection()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Enter the number of the collection you want to manage:");
    if (int.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out int choice) && collectionNames.ContainsKey(choice))
    {
        string selectedCollection = collectionNames[choice];
        Console.WriteLine($"Managing {selectedCollection} collection.");
        
        // Implement options for adding, editing, and searching for items within the selected collection.
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Invalid collection number. Please try again.");
    }
}
At this point, you have the basic structure of your "Collection Library" application, including the main menu and the ability to view and select collections for management.

To complete the application, you need to implement the following features:

Add functionality to manage items within each collection.
Implement input validation to ensure data integrity.
Develop the core logic for adding, editing, and searching items within collections.
Display items and their details when requested by the user.
Add and edit items in the collections.
Implement item search functionality (e.g., searching by ISBN for books).
Implement additional collections (Movies, Music) and their management logic.
The above steps provide a foundational structure for your application. You can build upon this structure to create a fully functional "Collection Library" application that showcases the use of different collection classes available in the .NET Framework.
